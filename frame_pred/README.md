Discussion points/hangups/confusion:
 - opencv2 use width, height. Numpy uses height, width
 - Different horizontal and vertical padding in Tensorflow
 - RNN model image is wrong? 12ximsize input, but should be 3 as paper described

Things we should do:
 - Try another epsilon(DQN): currently .001, in paper .3
